# Singleton Design Pattern

## Goal

The Singleton Design Pattern ensures that a class has only **one instance** throughout the application's lifecycle and provides a **global access point** to that instance. This pattern is commonly used when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Single Instance**: Ensures that only one instance of the class is created.
- **Global Access**: Provides a global point of access to the instance.
- **Lazy Initialization (optional)**: The instance is created when it is first needed, saving resources.

---

## Advantages

- **Controlled Access**: You have full control over how and when the single instance is accessed or modified.
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: By having only one instance of a class, the Singleton Pattern saves memory, especially when dealing with heavyweight objects.
- **Global State Management**: Useful for managing shared resources, such as configuration settings or connection pools, throughout an application.

---

## Disadvantages

- **Hidden Dependencies**: Since it provides a global access point, Singleton can make the code more prone to hidden dependencies, which can affect testability and maintainability.
- **Concurrency Issues**: In multi-threaded environments, ensuring that only one instance is created (especially with lazy initialization) can lead to race conditions if not handled properly.
- **Testing Difficulties**: Singletons can complicate unit testing, as they introduce global state that might persist between tests.
- **Potential Overuse**: While Singleton is useful, overusing it might lead to anti-patterns, making the code less modular and harder to maintain.

## When to Use Singleton?

- **Logging Service**: To ensure consistent logging behavior throughout an application.
- **Database Connection**: To manage a single shared connection pool.
- **Configuration Management**: For storing global configuration settings that should only exist once.
